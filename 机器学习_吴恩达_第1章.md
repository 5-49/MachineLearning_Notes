机器学习的一些例子：

- Database mining 
  - Large datasets from growth of automation/web. 
  - E.g., Web click data, medical records, biology, engineering 

- Applications can’t program by hand. 
  - E.g., Autonomous helicopter, handwriting recognition, most of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision. 
-  Self-customizing programs 
  - E.g., Amazon, Netflix product recommendations 
- Understanding human learning (brain, real AI).



# What is machine learning

Arthur Samuel (1959). Machine Learning: Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. 

Samuel写了应该跳棋程序，自对弈几万次，学习什么是好的布局，什么是不好的布局。

A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

E: 自己下棋，T：下棋，P：和对手玩win的概率
